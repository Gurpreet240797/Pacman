This project's repository includes different methods for searching through states, with and without using clues to guide the search. The main goal of the project was to create an AI system that can play the popular PAC game automatically. The project includes the following algorithms for building the AI system:

1. DFS (Depth First Search): It explores as far as possible along a branch of the game's possibilities before backtracking.

2. BFS (Breadth First Search): It explores all the possible moves at the current level before moving on to the next level.

3. UCS (Uniform Cost Search): It finds the path that has the lowest total cost among all possible paths.

4. A* Search Algorithm (Based on Manhattan Distance): It's a heuristic search algorithm that considers both the cost to reach a state and an estimate of the cost from that state to the goal.

In addition to these search algorithms, the project also includes various helper methods to make the implementation smoother and more efficient.
